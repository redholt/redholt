### ðŸ‘‹ Who am I?

Welcome to my GitHub

I am a former procurement specialist now self taught Data Analyst and Engineer currently working in local government within the UK. I have previously worked in analytical roles within FMCG and retail sectors. Some of my projects and links are below, as well as some information on my skills and the tools that I use. 

I also spend my free time tinkering with my Synology Box at home spending hours implementing systems to save myself seconds in real life!
